            </h1>
            <h2 class='date'>11/29/21</h2>
            <p class='desc'>
                My passion project was initially an Ignite Social Media webapp, but I have recently been occupied with both the Congressional App Challenge and mentoring projects in Boys and Girls Clubs and Old High Middle School. I want to expand and organize sessions and reestablish Code-Go. I am currently working on a hosting sessions at the Bentonville Public Library. I want to focus mainly on Robotics and Programming, starting from an elementary level suited for middle schoolers. 
                <br>
                I submited an app for the Congressional App challenge with Kate. I am also competing in CyberPatriot.

            <h1 class='title'>Trip to the University of Arkansas College of Engineering</h1>
            <h2 class='date'>10/1/21</h2>
            <p class='desc'>
               During my visit, I visited a variety of labs including the Chemical and Civil Engineering Labs. There was a plethora of new equipment that intrigued me. I was really appreciative of the fact that it was a holistic tour instead of a focus on a single department because I was exposed to new things that were completely foreign to me. The UofA building and campus was overall very nice and modern. 
                <br>
               The best part was after the tour when we attended a Quantum Computing lecture during lunch and followed it up with a hand-on Electrical Engineering lab. By using just elementary items such as LED's, Battery, and Play-doh, we learned and left to explore basic circuitry. I found it valuable and insightful that I was able to learn so much with such a simple, little lab.

            <h1 class='title'>Capture the Flag - Walmart Cyber Range</h1>
            <h2 class='date'>9/2/20 - 9/5/20</h2>
            <h4><i>"A technology that is 100% functional has 0% security, and a technology that is 100% secure has 0% functionality"
            </i></h4>
            <p class='desc'>Capture the Flag was a unique event and introduced me to a lot of new topics in Cybersecurity from the perspective of a hacker. We used BurpSuite for  Web Proxy, SQL tables for SQL injection, data validation error, and many more forms of attacks to hack into and find vulnerabilities in a fake e-commerce website JuiceShop. I gained exposure in navigating the Kali Linux OS which I found new and fun. The most significant idea I learned was that Cybersecurity is present in every field of technology because every technology has to find the right balance between functionality and security. This has also made me more conscious of my privacy and security in the technologies I use everyday.

            <h1 class='title'>Utilization Dashboard - Toshiba Kristi Weiser</h1>
            <h2 class='date'>10/19/20 - 10/30/20</h2>
            <h4><i>Selected winner of Afternoon Ignite class </i></h4>
            <p class='desc'>In the Toshiba project we in the Technology strand were tasked with coming up with a real-world, practical solution and pitch for the problem of visualizing tables of diverse data in a simple dashboard. I learned how to work as a group as we implemented a mix of allocated tasks and creative group brainstorming as we developed our solution. We had to manage our time effectively as we had a fixed two week time period. We had to work on our presentation skills and engage the judge to "sell our product." Overall, it was a wonderful experience that taught me valuable skills along with the joy of winning as the best solution in our class. Mrs. Weiser provided a variety of positve feedback and constructive criticism for us to improve upon. One advice I will work on was to simplify the visual representation, but also focus more on more creative, innovative solutions that can be showcased. Overall, I am glad I was able to participate in this competitive, purposeful event and look forward to competing in more related events.
